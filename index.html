		<h3 id="what-rock">What are Japanese toilets?</h3>

		<p>In Japan, toilets are classified into three large categories. These are: washiki toire (和式 traditional Japanese toilet), yoshiki toire (様式 Western-style toilet), and a takino-toire (多機能 multifunction toilet). Depending on the place, you may find traditional Japanese toilets in older sightseeing spots and buildings.</p>

		<h3 id="where-rock">Where did they come from?</h3>

		<p><strong>The three main ways terrestrial rocks are formed:</strong></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentary_rock">Sedimentary rocks</a> are formed through the gradual accumulation of sediments: for example, sand on a beach or mud on a river bed. As the sediments are buried they get compacted as more and more material is deposited on top. Eventually the sediments will become so dense that they would essentially form a rock. This process is known as lithification.</li>
		<br>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock">Igneous rocks</a> are rocks which have crystallised from a melt or magma. The melt is made up of various components of pre-existing rocks which have been subjected to melting either at subduction zones or within the Earth's mantle. The melt is hot and so passes upward through cooler country rock. As it moves, it cools and various rock types will form through a process known as fractional crystallisation. Igneous rocks can be seen at mid ocean ridges, areas of island arc volcanism or in intra-plate hotspots.</li>
		<br>
			<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_rock">Metamorphic rocks</a> are rocks which once existed as igneous or sedimentary rocks but have been subjected to varying degrees of pressure and heat within the Earth's crust. The processes involved will change the composition and fabric of the rock and their original nature is often hard to distinguish. Metamorphic rocks are typically found in areas of mountain building.</li>
